# differential geometry of curves and surfaces

- (t, n): osculating plane
- (n, b): normal plane
- (b, t): recitfying plane

垂直关系:
$$ |n|=1 \Rightarrow n\cdot n'=0 \Rightarrow n' = \tau b+ \mu t $$
$$ b' = (t\times n)' = t'\times n + t\times n'= t\times (\tau b+ \mu t) = \tau t\times b$$
$$ b' = -\tau n, \ t'= -\mu n$$

**regular surface**: a map $x: U\to V\cap S$ of an open set $U\subset R^2$ onto $U\cap V\subset R^3$
- differentiable 
- homeomorphism
- for each $q\in U$, differential $dx_q: R^2\to R^3$ is one-to-one

**homeomorphism(同胚)**: a function $f: X\to Y$ between two *topological space* $(X, \Gamma_x)$ and $(Y, \Gamma_y)$ is called a *homeomorphism* if it has the following properties:
- *bijection*
- continuous
- $f^{-1}$ is continuous

**diffeomorphic(微分同胚)**: two regular surface $S_1$ and $S_2$ are *diffeomorphic* if there exists a differentiable map $\varphi: S_1\to S_2$ with a differentiable inverse $\varphi ^{-1}: S_2\to S_1$. such a $\varphi$ is called a diffeomorphism(微分同胚映射) from $S_1$ to $S_2$.

> (**Heine-Borel**) let $[a, b]$ be a closed interval and let $I_\alpha, \alpha \in A$ be a collection of open intervals in $[a, b]$ such that $\cup_\alpha I_\alpha = [a, b]$. then it is possible to choose a finite number $I_{k_1}, I_{k_2}, ..., I_{k_n}$ of $I_\alpha$ such that $\cup I_{k_i}=I$

> **inverse funciton theorem**: let $F: U\subset R^n \to R^n$ be a differentiable mapping and suppose that at $p\in U$ the differential $dF_p: R^n\to R^n$ is an isomorphism. then there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ in $U$ and a neighborhood $W$ of $F(p)$ in $R^n$ such that $F: V\to W$ has a differentiable inverse $F^{-1}: W\to V$.

> **differential of a differentiable map**: let $F: U\subset R^n\to R^m$ be a differentiable map, to each $p\in U$ we associate a linear map $dF_p: R^n\to R^m$ which is called the differential of $F$ at $p$ and is defined as follows. let $w\in R^n$ and let $\alpha: (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\to U$ be a differentiable curve such that $\alpha(0)=p, \alpha'(0)=w$. by the chain rule, the curve $\beta = F\circ \alpha: (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\to R^m$ is also differentiable. then: $dF_p(w) = \beta'(0)$

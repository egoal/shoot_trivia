# differential geometry of curves and surfaces

- (t, n): osculating plane
- (n, b): normal plane
- (b, t): recitfying plane

垂直关系:
$$ |n|=1 \Rightarrow n\cdot n'=0 \Rightarrow n' = \tau b+ \mu t $$
$$ b' = (t\times n)' = t'\times n + t\times n'= t\times (\tau b+ \mu t) = \tau t\times b$$
$$ b' = -\tau n, \ t'= -\mu n$$

**regular surface**: a map $x: U\to V\cap S$ of an open set $U\subset R^2$ onto $U\cap V\subset R^3$
- differentiable 
- homeomorphism
- for each $q\in U$, differential $dx_q: R^2\to R^3$ is one-to-one

**homeomorphism(同胚)**: a function $f: X\to Y$ between two *topological space* $(X, \Gamma_x)$ and $(Y, \Gamma_y)$ is called a *homeomorphism* if it has the following properties:
- *bijection*
- continuous
- $f^{-1}$ is continuous

**diffeomorphic(微分同胚)**: two regular surface $S_1$ and $S_2$ are *diffeomorphic* if there exists a differentiable map $\varphi: S_1\to S_2$ with a differentiable inverse $\varphi ^{-1}: S_2\to S_1$. such a $\varphi$ is called a diffeomorphism(微分同胚映射) from $S_1$ to $S_2$.

#### 02 Funcdamentals of Unconstrainted Optimization:

local minimizer $ \Rightarrow \triangledown f(x^*)=0, \triangledown ^2 f(x^*) $ is **positive semidefinite**

local minimizer $\Leftarrow \triangledown f(x^*)=0, \triangledown ^2 f(x^*)$ is **positive definite**

when $f$ is convex, any local minimizer $x^*$ is a global minimizer of $f$, if in addition $f$ is differntiable, then any stationary point $x^*$ is a global minimizer

in general, nonlinear conjugate gradient directions are much more effective than the steepest descent direction and are almost as simple to compute

poorly scaled: 对$x^*$不同维度的影响将导致*f*的巨大不同: $ f(x)=10^9 x_1^2 + x_2^2 $, 常规而言相比于line search, trust region更难修正和避免

#### 03 Line Search Methods:

line search is done in two stages: a bracketing phase finds a interval containing desirable step lengths, and a bisection or interpolation phase computes a good step length within this interval

Wolfe conditions:
$$ f(x_k+\alpha p_k) \le f(x_k) + c_1 \alpha \triangledown f_k^Tp_k \\
\triangledown f(x_k+\alpha p_k)^T p_k \ge c_2 \triangledown f_k^T p_k $$
with $ 0 < c_1 < c_2 < 1 $ 【下降了 & 下降不快了】

#### 15 Fundamentals of Algorithms for Nonliear Constrained Optimization:

a nonlinear optimization problem with linear equality constraints is, from a methematical point of view, the same as an unconstrained problem

Maratos effect: some algorithms based on merit functions or filters may fail to converge rapidly beacause they reject steps that make good progress toward a solution

#### 16. Quadratic Programming

等式约束:
$$ \min_x \ q(x)= \frac 12 x^TGx+x^Tc \\
s.t. \ Ax=b
\tag {16-1}
$$

KKT条件:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} G & -A^T \\ A & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x^* \\ \lambda^* \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -c \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\tag {16-2}
$$

记，$Z$为$A$零空间的一组基: $AZ=0$
* let $A$ have full row rank, $Z^TGZ$ is positive definite, then:
$$ K= \begin{bmatrix} G & A^T \\ A & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
is nonsingular, and hence there is a unique vector pair $(x^*, \lambda^*)$ satisfying (16-2)
